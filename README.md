# Discovery

The DigitalState Discovery microservice provides a microservice location registry for inter-microservice communication.

> Note: Currently, the discovery system is very rudimentary; a json file exposing microservice endpoints. This simple solution is used to help with discovery integration across the DigitalState platform until we upgrade our solution to something more robust and dynamic.
